        <h1>My Dearest Lina,</h1>
        <p>
            From the very first moment we met, you’ve been the most incredible part of my life. I still remember our first date on October 22nd (cuz for u it's our first date), it was the beginning of something so special, something I never want to let go of. And these last few days? They were beyond amazing. Every second with you feels like magic, like time slows down just for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lina, you make me sooo happy, so unbelievably lucky, and incredibly proud to have you as my girl. You make my world brighter, my heart fuller, and my soul lighter. Every little thing about you, the way you smile, the way you look at me, the way you make me feel so loved reminds me why I love you more than words can ever say.
        </p>
        <p>
            I miss you more than you can imagine, and I can’t wait to see you again. Every moment apart just makes me want you more. Until then, just know that my heart is always with you, counting down the days until I can hold you in my arms again.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">I love you endlessly, abentii.</p>
        <p class="signature">Forever yours,<br>The love of ur life, Othmane</p>
